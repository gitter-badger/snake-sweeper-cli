Also... just playing around with Python.

#### Dependencies:
None as of yet but I would still use `virtualenv` and/or `virtualenvwrapper`

#### Running the Game:
TODO

#### Running Tests:
In Progress

I'd like this to be an interactive shell script with the ability to run all
or some unittests and **maybe** check for PEP8 compliance

Hopefully like:
`test_runer board` for the board unittests or...
`test_runer all` for all unittests
